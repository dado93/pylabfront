# Labfront data
How are Labfront data organized and structured?
In Labfront data, we have four main sources of data:
- Garmin Connect: these data come from [Garmin Health API](https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/health-api/) and are retrieved from Labfront through Garmin Connect app
- Garmin Device: these data come directly from the Garmin devices, and are retrieved from Labfront through [Garmin Companion SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/health-sdk/overview/)
- Questionnaire: inside the app, it is possible to have multiple questionnaires with questions asked to the participants
- Todos: these are reminders for activities and tasks that the subjects can check as done
